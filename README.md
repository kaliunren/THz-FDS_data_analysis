Try to analysis the data of THz-FDS

I wish someone who also works at the continuous-wave terhaertz spectroscopy to help revise my method.

## Context:
This program can acquire the amplitude and phase of the orignal data, by using the Hilbert transformation.

## Running environment:
Anaconda + Visual Studio Code
