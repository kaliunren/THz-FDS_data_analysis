# THz-FDS_data_analysis
Try to analysis the data of THz-FDS

I wish that someone who also works at the continuous-wave terhaertz spectroscopy can help revise my method.

## Context:

This program can acquire the amplitude and phase from the orignal data by using the Hilbert transformation.
Reference:DOI:10.1364/OE.25.016860

It can also smooth the signal by converting the signal from frequecny domain to time domain.

And then you can calcuate the infractive index and absorption coefficient.

## Running environment:

Anaconda + Visual Studio Code
