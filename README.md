# THz-FDS_data_analysis
Try to analysis the data of THz-FDS

I wish someone who also works at the continuous-wave terhaertz spectroscopy to help revise my method.

## Context:

This program can acquire the amplitude and phase of the orignal data, by using the Hilbert transformation.

It can also smooth the signal by converting the signal from frequecny domain to time domain.

And then you can calcuate the infractive index and absorption coefficient.

## Running environment:

Anaconda + Visual Studio Code
